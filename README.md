# vteklib
Library for easy and fast build scientific-style plots

`pip install vteklib`

The main config file is vteklib/vtek_style.mplstyle
You can download it manually and use like:
`import matplotlib.oyplot as plt` & `plt.style.use('...path_to_vtek.mplstyle')`

All other code is a wrapper for easier use a data from excel and csv tables. Maybe some day it'll become a part of web-app.
